# mod2final

This code creates an outfit generator using an ESP32 and a button, joystick, and potentiometer. You should run the Arduiono Code in the Arduino IDE and the reat in your IDE of choice (I used VS Code). Makue sure that you have Bootstrap5 installed. After attaching headers to the ESP32, connect the devices to the ESP32 at the given pins. To use, run the arduino code and open up the HTML in Chrome, then you should be prompted to select a port. Then, have fun! The potentiometer controls volume, the joystick is used to select clothing items, and the button is used to finalize an outfit.
